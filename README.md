This project contains two interactive Power BI dashboards analyzing credit card customer and transaction data.
The Customer Report dashboard provides insights on total customers, credit limits, average utilization, transaction amounts, and satisfaction scores,
while the Transaction Report dashboard visualizes weekly revenue trends, top spending customers, and spending category patterns. 
Both dashboards are fully interactive with slicers for gender, age group, income, and week, and include KPI cards, trend charts, and buttons for smooth navigation.
Custom DAX measures were created to calculate metrics such as current and previous week revenue, average per customer, and WoW Growth %,
enabling clear and actionable business insights.
